	» Booking form connected to PayPal
	» Optional availability verification
	» Season management
	» Weekly bookings supported
	» Fixed days bookings supported

With the **Booking Calendar Contact Form** you can create a **classic contact form** or a **booking form with a reservation calendar**, connected to a PayPal payment button. The reservation calendar lets the customer select the start (ex: check-in) and end (ex: checkout) dates.

The **reservation calendar** is an optional item, so it can be disabled to create a **general purpose contact form**.

There are two types of bookings available in the calendar configuration: full day bookings or partial day bookings. With full day bookings the whole day is blocked / reserved while in partial day bookings the start and end dates are partially blocked as used for example in **room/hotel bookings**.

Features:

* **Booking form** connected to PayPal: After clicking the reservation / book button on the booking form, the user is redirected to PayPal and after completing the payment three emails will be sent: the automatic PayPal notification, the booking confirmation email to the user sent from the website and the notification email to the website administrator containing the booking details. At this point the booking will be confirmed and will appear in the bookings list and calendar. 
* **Reservation / booking calendar** with optional availability verification: The dates are blocked in the calendar only if the "bookings overlap" option is enabled (it's enabled by default).
* **Season management:** Configuration accepts different prices for different dates (ex: low / medium / high season prices, special date's prices, etc...)
* Supports **full-day bookings** or **partial day bookings** as used in hotels / room reservations (details mentioned above)
* Allows to disable/hide the booking calendar to convert the booking form in a **general purpose contact form**

Other features also present in this version:

* Built-in captcha anti-spam protection on the booking form
* Easy visual selection of the start and end dates
* Configurable email texts
* Configurable validation messages
* Lets to assign a user to the calendar, this way a user with editor access will access his/her own booking calendar
* List of bookings with print option
* Supports bookings of a fixed length, example weekly bookings
* Price structure can be defined for each number of days
* Calendar configurable settings: date format, min/max dates, block dates, mark holidays, select working weekdays, calendar pages

What isn't included in the free version described here?

* The Form Builder for customizing the form is present only in the pro version. The free version works with the classic predefined form included on it.
* The connection to PayPal is part of the booking process in the free version, so it cannot be disabled on it. The pro version has additional code to work with or without the PayPal connection.
* Coupons/discount codes and other minor features are present only in the pro version.

Important!: Use the "Troubleshoot Area" area only if you are experiencing conflicts with third party plugins, with the theme scripts or with the character encoding.

*Script load method:* Change the script load method if the booking form doesn't appear in the public website. In most cases changing the booking form load method to "direct" will solve the problem, however if possible leave the default setting "classic".

*Character encoding:* Update the charset if you are getting problems displaying special/non-latin characters in the booking form, reservation emails or booking list. After updated you need to edit/enter the special characters again. 

= Min and max number of nights to be booked =

*Minimum number of nights to be booked:* If set to a number greater than zero, the booking form won't accept bookings of less than the indicated nights.

* Disabled and special dates: Click a date to mark it as disabled, for example for disabling holidays or other dates where reservations aren't allowed.
* Enable Fixed Reservation Length?: Use this for allowing only bookings of a specific number of days. More details in the next section 

= Fixed Reservation Length = 

If you enable the option "Fixed Reservation Length" for the calendar that means that you want to accept only bookings of the specified length (number of days), for example for accepting only 7 days bookings.

The settings fields for this option are:

* Fixed reservation length (days): The number of days that must have the booking.
* Start Reservation Date: Use this for allowing specific weekdays as start of the reservation, for example if you want to indicate that all the bookings must start on a Monday.
